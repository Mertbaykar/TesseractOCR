# Extracting text from files (etc. image and pdf) by the help of Tesseract Engine and using data for several purposes 
TesseractOCR project's goal is to use Tesseract Engine to extract texts from images which will be manipulated by various image methods and use the texts
for several things( etc. creating pdf using text which could be extracted from other pdf and image files). After achieving this goal, there will be some 
work to translate the extracted text and use in similar stuff.
